### Solution
Brand prevalence at certain locations and times is extremely valueable infromation as it allows marketing organizations to apply targeted ads in areas where their brand is struggling.  When we say brand, we are mostly focused on clothing brands.  For the purposes of this solution, Nike (swoosh logo) and Adidas (trefoil logo).  The solution could enhanced to start tracking other brands, such as Puma.

### Model Training
The first step to accomplish this goal is to train a model using a SageMaker Notebook Instance to detect Nike and Adidas logos.  The process for creating a dataset and training a model for this solution is documented in the following [gist](gist.md).
